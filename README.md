# AI-Powered Automated Data Insights Platform

This is an AI-powered data analysis platform built using Streamlit that allows users to upload datasets, explore data insights, visualize correlations, and automatically train machine learning models. It simplifies the process of performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training, making it accessible for anyone with a dataset.

## Features
- **Dataset Upload**: Users can upload their own CSV datasets.
- **Data Preview**: View the first few rows of the dataset.
- **Missing Data Visualization**: Visualize missing data with a heatmap.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate an automated EDA report using Sweetviz.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Visualize correlations between features.
- **Automated Machine Learning**: Train a Random Forest model (regression or classification) on the dataset.
- **Model Download**: Download the trained model for future use.
